AirBnb Console - Project's Intention

Similar to how we created a simple shell using the C Language, we are creating a command interpreter that works in similar fashion but is limited to specific use-cases.

Use-cases our project will be able to manage:

Create new objects (ex: new User or a new Place).
Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc).
Update attributes of an object.
Destroy an object.
